#  Quantizer 

The Quantizer is a PNG-quantization tool strongly inspired by [ImageAlpha](https://pngmini.com).
It uses the same existing algorithms: [PngQuant](https://pngquant.org/lib/), [Posterizer](https://github.com/kornelski/mediancut-posterizer) and [pngnq](http://pngnq.sourceforge.net) to transform any PNG into a 8-bit palettized image. This is an efficient way of generating a lighter image file while preserving perceptual quality. Please see the `LICENSE_EXTERNAL.md` file for the libraries respective licenses.

### Features

* Three quantization algorithms.
* Custom number of colors in the palette.
* Support for dithering.
* Support removing the alpha channel of an image.
* Compare the size of your image before and after.
